    <h2>Your right to cancel</h2>
    <p>As an online (distance) sale, you have a legal right to cancel your order within <strong>14 days</strong> of receiving it, without giving a reason, under the Consumer Contracts Regulations 2013. Once you've told us you're cancelling, you then have a further <strong>14 days</strong> to send the item back to us.</p>

    <h2>Condition of returned goods</h2>
    <p>Items should be returned unused, in their original packaging where possible, and in a condition that lets us resell or restock them. Perishable or opened food and toiletry items can't be returned once opened, for hygiene reasons, unless faulty.</p>

    <h2>Who pays for return postage</h2>
    <p>You're responsible for the cost of returning an item unless it arrived faulty, damaged or wasn't what you ordered: in those cases we'll cover it or arrange collection.</p>

    <h2>Refunds</h2>
    <p>Once we've received and checked the returned item, we'll refund you within 14 days to your original payment method. We may make a deduction if the item's value has been reduced by handling beyond what's needed to check it.</p>

    <h2>Exchanges</h2>
    <p>Prefer a swap over a refund? Choose "Exchange" when you start your return and tell us what you'd like instead; we'll confirm availability by email.</p>

    <h2>Complaints</h2>
    <p>If something's gone wrong that isn't covered above (a delivery issue, a billing question, anything else), email us and we'll aim to resolve it within 5 working days. If you're not happy with how we've handled a complaint, you can also refer it to an independent alternative dispute resolution (ADR) provider.</p>
