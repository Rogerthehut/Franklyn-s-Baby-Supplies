const FAQS=[
 {q:"How does delivery work?",a:"Enter your postcode at checkout or on the delivery preview to see sample time slots. If you're within Franklyn's own delivery area (London, Hertfordshire and Bedfordshire, inside the M25), he'll often deliver it himself; everywhere else in the UK goes out with a courier partner. You'll never need to choose between the two: you just pick a day and time that suits you."},
 {q:"Is slot booking guaranteed?",a:"Not yet. Selecting a delivery window today shows you what a real booking calendar will look like, but it doesn't reserve capacity. Your order and payment are real; the exact delivery time is confirmed separately once fulfilment is fully connected."},
 {q:"What's the difference between a one-off order and a repeat box?",a:"A one-off order is a single purchase, delivered once. \"Repeat & top up\" puts everyday essentials like nappies and wipes on a schedule (every 2, 4 or 6 weeks) that you can skip or pause any time."},
 {q:"Do I need an account to order?",a:"No, checkout works as a guest; you just need a valid email address for your order confirmation and any returns."},
 {q:"How do I return or exchange something?",a:"Use \"Returns & replacements\" in the footer of any page. You'll need your order number and the email address you checked out with. See our full Returns & complaints policy at /returns-policy for the details."},
 {q:"Is payment secure?",a:"Yes. Checkout and card payment are handled entirely by Stripe, a PCI-compliant payment provider used by millions of businesses. Franklyn's never sees or stores your card details."},
 {q:"Can I suggest a product you don't stock yet?",a:"Please do: use \"Suggest an idea\" in the footer. The most-voted suggestions directly shape what gets sourced next."},
